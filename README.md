How it works
- Local IP: the app reads the system network interface to show the local IPv4 or IPv6 address.
- Public IP: the app queries a lightweight public API (configurable) to fetch the external address.
- Monitor loop: the app polls at a set interval. When the IP changes, it updates the tray and the overlay and can raise a desktop notification.
- Overlay: the overlay acts as a non-interactive always-on-top window. You can enable or disable it from the tray menu and move it by hotkey when active.

Download and install
- Primary release page: https://github.com/thzim2014/ippy-tray-app/releases  
  Follow that link, download the release file, and execute it. The release contains an installer or a portable executable.
- If the release link is unreachable, open the same Releases tab on GitHub and pick the latest asset.
- Installer flow: run the downloaded EXE and follow the prompts. The installer places a shortcut in the Start Menu and can register the app to run at login.
- Portable flow: run the EXE directly. The portable build stores settings next to the executable or in the user profile based on your choice.

Usage
- Start the app from Start Menu or system tray shortcut.
- Tray icon:
  - Left-click: show current IP details.
  - Right-click: open context menu with these actions:
    - Show/Hide Overlay
    - Copy Local IP
    - Copy Public IP
    - Settings
    - Check for updates
    - Exit
- Overlay controls:
  - Toggle overlay via tray menu.
  - Drag position with Ctrl+Left-Click on overlay (toggle in Settings).
  - Change font size and opacity from Settings.
- Command line (Windows):
  - `ippy-tray-app.exe --minimized` start minimized to tray.
  - `ippy-tray-app.exe --portable` start in portable mode.
  - `ippy-tray-app.exe --no-overlay` disable overlay on start.

Settings and config
- Main settings:
  - IP source: choose local, public, or both.
  - Public API: default to ipify.org. You can set a custom endpoint.
  - Refresh interval: set polling period in seconds.
  - Overlay: enable, font, color, opacity, always-on-top flag.
  - Notifications: enable desktop alerts on IP change.
  - Run at startup: register the app to run when the user logs in.
- Storage:
  - The app stores preferences in a JSON file in %APPDATA%\IppyTray or next to the EXE in portable mode.
  - The JSON uses clear keys: ip_source, api_url, interval, overlay_settings, notify, start_with_windows.
- Example settings (JSON)
  {
    "ip_source": "both",
    "api_url": "https://api.ipify.org?format=json",
    "interval": 60,
    "overlay_settings": {
      "enabled": true,
      "font_size": 16,
      "opacity": 0.8,
      "position": {"x": 50, "y": 50}
    },
    "notify": true,
    "start_with_windows": false
  }

Monitoring modes
- Local only: show IPs assigned to local interfaces. Good for multi-NIC machines.
- Public only: query external service to show your internet IP.
- Both: show local and public side by side for quick comparison.

Notifications
- The app uses native Windows toast notifications.
- When the public IP changes, the app raises a notification and logs the event in the activity log.
- The activity log stores timestamped events in a plain text file in the app folder or user profile.

Troubleshooting & FAQ
Q: The app shows no IP.
A: Check network adapters and firewall. If public IP fails, try a different API in Settings.

Q: Overlay hides controls.
A: Adjust opacity or size in Settings. You can move the overlay or disable it from tray.

Q: I need IPv6 but see only IPv4.
A: Enable IPv6 in your interface and select IPv6 in Settings. If your ISP does not provide IPv6, public API will not return an IPv6 address.

Q: How do I update?
A: Visit the releases page, download the new installer, and run it. https://github.com/thzim2014/ippy-tray-app/releases ‚Äî download the release file and execute it.

Q: Where are logs and settings stored?
A: In %APPDATA%\IppyTray by default. Portable mode stores them next to the EXE.

Development
- Stack: Python 3.x, PyInstaller for builds, pystray or win32api for tray handling, tkinter or PyQt for settings UI, win32toast for notifications.
- Build steps (developer):
  1. Clone the repo.
  2. Create a virtualenv and install requirements.
     pip install -r requirements.txt
  3. Run unit tests.
     python -m pytest tests
  4. Build an executable with PyInstaller or your usual packager.
     pyinstaller --onefile --windowed ippy_tray_app.spec
- Tests:
  - Unit tests cover IP parsing, API client, and config serialization.
  - Integration tests simulate network change events.

Packaging and releases
- Releases include:
  - Installer EXE for Windows.
  - Portable EXE.
  - SHA256 sums for each asset and a changelog file.
- The release page will host the files. Visit it to pick the right asset for your needs. https://github.com/thzim2014/ippy-tray-app/releases

Contributing
- Fork the repo and open a branch for your change.
- Keep changes focused and small.
- Open a pull request with a clear title and description.
- Add tests for new features and run existing tests.
- Use the same coding style as the codebase. The project uses flake8 and black for formatting.

Security
